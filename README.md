# QA quiz app

The [QA Quiz App](https://quiz-app-alpha-virid.vercel.app/) is designed to provide users with a seamless quiz-taking experience. Leveraging the power of Nuxt and Xata, the app fetches questions from a serverless database, tracks user performance, and displays results in real-time. This project serves as an excellent example of how to integrate modern front-end framework, Nuxt with scalable back-end services.
